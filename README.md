This application is a fragment of a wellness app. 
It has 3 data collections: Posts, Users and resources.
There are views attached to each data collection for editing, indix, new and show.
All the routes, GET PUT POST DELETE are functional for the users.mjs and posts.mjs
For resources.mjs, there is only create and delete. There is no edit functionality here.
There are a validation for the username, and if the username already exists, there will be an alert and then the user is redirected to the New page again.
Basic css styling was provided for the main page, but the rest of the views, even though I have the css file, and I have linked it in DefaultLayout, its still not showing.
I have created a different user for this project so that all of my database is not shared.
